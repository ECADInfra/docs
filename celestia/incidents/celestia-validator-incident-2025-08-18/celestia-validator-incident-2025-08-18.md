- **00:30-00:45 UTC / 17:30-17:45 PDT**: Service restart period with peer count drop
- **00:45-02:45 UTC / 17:45-19:45 PDT**: Sustained missed blocks, 2-6 per 10-minute period

#### **Connected Peers**
- **23:15-00:30 UTC / 16:15-17:30 PDT**: Stable at 10 peers
- **00:30 UTC / 17:30 PDT**: Sharp drop to 0 peers (planned restart)
- **00:45 UTC / 17:45 PDT**: Recovery to 10 peers
- **00:45-02:45 UTC / 17:45-19:45 PDT**: Stable at 10 peers

#### **Total Missed Blocks**
- **23:15-00:30 UTC / 16:15-17:30 PDT**: Steady increase from ~9 to ~20 missed blocks
- **00:30-00:45 UTC / 17:30-17:45 PDT**: Sharp increase during restart

- **Baseline**: ~5 seconds
- **Incident Spikes**: Consistently 10-12.5 seconds from 23:15 UTC / 16:15 PDT onwards
- **Correlation**: Sustained high block times throughout incident period

#### **Missing Validators**
- **Sustained High Numbers**: Frequent spikes reaching 47 missing validators
- **Peak**: 47 missing validators at 00:18:00 UTC / 17:18:00 PDT
- **Network Impact**: Confirms distributed consensus issue affecting multiple validators

### Our Analysis and Hypotheses

#### **Root Cause Hypothesis: Distributed Consensus Coordination Issue**
**Evidence Supporting This:**
- **Multiple Validators Affected**: 47 missing validators indicates distributed problem
- **Synchronized Performance**: Multiple validators hitting 10-12 second block times simultaneously
- **Natural Resolution**: Issue resolved at 02:43 UTC / 19:43 PDT without local intervention

**Why This Makes Sense:**
- 47 missing validators represents a substantial portion of the network
- Synchronized block time spikes suggest coordinated network problems
- Natural resolution indicates external network improvement
- The issue was not isolated to our infrastructure

#### **Resolution Mechanism: Natural Network Recovery**
**Evidence Supporting This:**
- **No Local Intervention**: Issue resolved at 02:43 UTC / 19:43 PDT without our action
- **Distributed Pattern**: Multiple validators affected simultaneously
- **Timing**: Resolution occurred during broader network improvement

### Lessons Learned
1. **Distributed Issues**: Consensus problems can affect multiple validators simultaneously
2. **Monitoring Effectiveness**: Prometheus metrics enabled early detection
3. **Data-Driven Response**: Infrastructure assessment prevented unnecessary restarts
4. **Natural Recovery**: Some network issues resolve without local intervention

- **Correlation**: Spikes align with periods of missed blocks and high timeout durations

#### **Missing Validators**
- **Significant Spikes**: Up to ~40 missing validators around 16:00, 16:30, and 17:45 UTC / 09:00, 09:30, and 10:45 PDT
- **Network Impact**: Indicates distributed coordination issues, not isolated problems

### Our Analysis and Hypotheses

#### **Root Cause Hypothesis: Distributed Validator Updates**
**Evidence Supporting This:**
- **Timing**: Issue started at 15:30 UTC / 08:30 PDT, coinciding with v5.0.2 rollout
- **Network Pattern**: 40+ missing validators suggests coordinated network activity
- **Resolution**: Fresh peer connections after upgrade stabilized the network
- **Log Pattern**: Consistent high timeout durations suggest network coordination issues

**Why This Makes Sense:**
- Multiple validators updating simultaneously would cause peer connection churn
- Consensus coordination issues would arise during network transitions
- Fresh connections after upgrade would resolve coordination problems
- The issue resolved naturally after joining the updated validator set

#### **Resolution Mechanism: Fresh Peer Connections**
**Evidence Supporting This:**
- **Service Restart**: Clean process restart established new peer connections
- **Network Stabilization**: Service stabilized after establishing connections to updated peers

### Lessons Learned
1. **Network Coordination**: Major version updates can cause distributed coordination issues
2. **Proactive Response**: v5.0.2 upgrade was the correct response to network instability
3. **Monitoring Effectiveness**: Prometheus metrics enabled early detection and data-driven decisions
4. **Fresh Connections**: Service restart can resolve peer coordination issues during network transitions
